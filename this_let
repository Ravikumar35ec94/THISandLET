THIS:
1) In object method, this refers to the "owner" of the method
var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id     : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

2) When alone, this refers to global object
var x = this;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

LET:
This introdused block scope in javascript which was not there before. So let keyword makes a variable accessible only inside block where declared
